I am pleased to announce version 1.1 of the GNU distribution of the
Mach 3.0 interface generator `MiG' Mach kernel.  It may be found in
the file (about 141 KB compressed) ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mig/mig-1.1.tar.gz.

This release is identical to the previous alpha version 1.0.2.

You need this tool to compile the gnumach and hurd distributions,
and to compile GNU libc for the Hurd.

Bug reports relating to this distribution should be sent to
bug-hurd@gnu.org.  Requests for assistance should be made on
help-hurd@gnu.org. 

The md5sum checksum for this distibution is
